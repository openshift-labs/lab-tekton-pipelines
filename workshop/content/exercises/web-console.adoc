You can watch the execution of a pipelinerun through the OpenShift web console
by clicking on the **Console** tab next to the **Terminal** tab at the center top
of the workshop in your browser.

Make sure you select the **Developer** option from the dropdown in the top left
corner of the web console as shown below:

Next, select the Project dropdown menu and choose the project namespace you have
been working with. As a reminder, the project you are using is called **%project_namespace%**.

Once you have selected your project, click on the **Pipelines** tab on the left
hand side of the web console. You will see the name of the pipeline and, under
the **Last Run** column, the name of the current pipelinerun.

You should also see the **Last Run Time** column as the last column on the **Pipelines**
tab:

By clicking on the three dots to the right of the **Last Run Time**, you will see
how you can trigger a pipelinerun from the web console using the Start Last Run option
to re-execute the most recent pipelinerun of a pipeline or use the Start option
to kick off the `pipeline` in its current state. There is also a Delete option to remove
pipelines from your project namespace.

Now that you have seen some options of using OpenShift Pipelines through the web
console, you can proceed with viewing the current pipelinerun. To view it, click
on the pipelinerun name under the **Last Run** column.

After clicking on the pipelinerun name, you should see the tasks as part of
your pipeline executing similar to whats displayed below:

By hovering your cursor over the `build` task, you can see the steps that the task
will execute. You can also do this with the `deploy` task.

Since this is not the official OpenShift 4.2 web console, you will not be able to
view the logs through the web console, but this will be available in the official
OpenShift 4.2 web console release.

To verify the pipelinerun executed successfully, head back to the terminal by
clicking on the **Terminal** tab next to the **Console** tab at the center top of
the workshop in your browser.

Once you see the successful deployment verification message shown below, you can
go out and see the application running on OpenShift:

[source,bash]
----
[deploy : oc] deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/nodejs-ex rolled out
----

If you do not see the message, just wait a minute as the pipelinerun finishes and
watch the logs continue to come in from `tkn`.

You can confirm the successful deployment after the logs show the output above by
running the `tkn` command you ran earlier to list the pipelineruns:

[source,bash,role=execute-2]
----
tkn pr ls
----

Under the STATUS column of the output, you should see Succeeded if the pipelinerun
was successful. You can also see how long the pipelinerun took to execute under the DURATION column.

To see the application you have deployed, click Continue to head to the next section.
