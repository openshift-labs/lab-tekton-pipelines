For this tutorial, you're going to use a simple nodejs application. The workshop is configured to provide you a pre-created project. We can verify the name of the project with:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc project -q
----

Building container images using build tools such as `S2I`, `Buildah`, `Kaniko`, etc require privileged access to the cluster. OpenShift default security settings do not allow access to privileged containers unless specifically configured.

This workshop has created a `ServiceAccount` with the required permissions to run privileged pods for building images. The name of this service account is easy to remember. It is named `pipeline`. You can verify that `pipeline` has been created by running the following command:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc get serviceaccount pipeline
----

You will use the link:https://github.com/sclorg/nodejs-ex[nodejs-ex] sample application during this tutorial, which is a simple nodejs application.

Create the Kubernetes objects for deploying the nodejs-ex app on OpenShift by running the command below. The deployment will not complete since there are no container images built for the nodejs-ex application yet. That you will do in the following sections through a CI/CD pipeline.

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
oc create -f sampleapp/sampleapp.yaml
----

To verify the resources needed to support nodejs-ex have been created, you can head
out to the OpenShift web console by clicking on the **Console** tab next to the
**Terminal** tab at the center top of the workshop in your browser.

Make sure you select the **Developer** option from the dropdown in the top left
corner of the web console as shown below:

Next, select the Project dropdown menu shown below and choose the project namespace you have
been working with. As a reminder, the project you are using is %project_namespace%.

Next, click on the **Topology** tab on the left side of the web console if you don't
see the what's in the image below. Once in the topology view, you can see the deployment
config for the nodejs-ex application, which is what is shown in the image below:

image:../images/topology-view.png[Topology View]

You'll notice the white circle around the nodejs-ex deployment config. This means
that nothing is actually running yet in your OpenShift project. The resources created
are supplementary to the application, such as a route (i.e., url).

Head back over to the terminal by clicking on the **Terminal** tab next to the **Console**
tab that you used to get the web console.

In the next section, you'll learn how to use Tekton `tasks`. Clear your terminal before continuing:

[source,bash,role=execute-1]
----
clear
